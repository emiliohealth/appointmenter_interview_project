# README

During this part of the interview, we'd like to pair with you on building out a bit of a frontend in React. Should be fun!

# This Repo

This repo contains a small Rails app using the `react-rails` gem. The app has one table called `Appointment`. `Appointment` has two fields: `name` and `start_time`.

If you start the app and travel to `http://localhost:3000/appointments`, you should see a list of appointments already in the SQLite database.

This view is rendered by the React component in `app/javascript/components/Appointments.js`.

# Goal

During our pairing time, we'll add a few features to our UI.

To give you an idea of the things we'll do, we'll want to manipulate some of the data we receive from the server and hit one or two API endpoints on our Rails server.

# Logistics

The plan is to use your computer to do the pairing, so if you could please try to get the app up and running ahead of the interview, that'd be helpful. We can use Zoom to do the screensharing.

Please reach out if you run into any issues or have any questions!
